        <p>High-quality graphics format often used for storing images with many colors,  such as digital photos; short for "TIFF;" includes support for layers and  pages.<br /><br />TIFF files can be saved in an uncompressed (lossless) format or  may incorporate .JPEG (lossy) compression; they  may also use LZW lossless compression, which reduces the TIFF file size, but  does not reduce the quality of the image.<br /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Stands for "Tagged Image File Format." It is graphics file format created in the  1980's to be the standard image format across multiple computer platforms. The  TIFF format can handle color depths ranging from 1-bit to 24-bit. Since the  original TIFF standard was introduced, people have been making many small  improvements to the format, so there are now around 50 variations of the TIFF  format. So much for a universal format. Recently, JPEG has become the most  popular universal format, because of its small file size and Internet  compatibility.<br /></p>
