        <p>Compressed graphic format standarized by the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts  Group) group; commonly used for storing digital photos since the format supports  up to 24-bit color; also a common format for publishing Web graphics; compressed  using lossy compression, which may noticeably reduce the image  quality if a high amount of compression is used.<br /><br /></p>
        <p><b>jpe</b>
        </p>
        <p>24-bit compressed JPEG graphic format that is commonly used for Web graphics;  best suited for photos or images that contain lots of colors; also used by most  digital cameras for saving digital photos.<br /><br />JPEG images use lossy  compression, which means some image quality is lost when the compression is  applied; the more compression is used, the less clear the image will appear.<br /></p>

        <p>The term actually stands for "Joint Photographic Experts Group," because that is  the name of the committee that developed the format. But you don't have to  remember that because even computer nerds will think you're weird if you mention  what JPEG stands for. Instead, remember that a JPEG is a compressed image file  format. JPEG images are not limited to a certain amount of color, like GIF images are. Therefore, the JPEG format is best  for compressing photographic images. So if you see a large, colorful image on  the Web, it is most likely a JPEG file.<br /><br />While JPEG images can contain  colorful, high-resolution image data, it is a lossy format, which means some quality is lost when  the image is compressed. If the image is compressed too much, the graphics  become noticeably "blocky" and some of the detail is lost. Like GIFs, JPEGs are  crossplatform, meaning the same file  will look the same on both a Mac and PC.</p>
