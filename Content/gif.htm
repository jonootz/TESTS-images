        <h1>gif</h1>
        <p>Image file that may contain up to 256 indexed colors; color palette may be a  predefined set of colors or may be adapted to the colors in the image; lossless format, meaning the clarity of the image is not  compromised with GIF compression.<br /><br />GIFs are common format for Web  graphics, epecially small images and images that contain text, such as  navigation buttons; however, JPEG (.JPG) images are  better for showing photos because they are not limited in the number of colors  they can display.<br /><br />GIF images can also be animated and saved as "animated  GIFs," which are often used to display basic animations on websites; they may  also include transparent pixels, which allow them to blend with different color  backgrounds; however, pixels in a GIF image must be either fully transparent or  fully opaque, so the transparency cannot be faded like a .PNG image.</p>

        <p>The letters "GIF" actually stand for "Graphics Interchange Format," but you  don't need to remember that. What you should know is that a GIF is a compressed  image file format. GIF images use a compression formula originally developed by  CompuServe (which is why you see the term "CompuServe GIF" in Photoshop, for  those of you that care). GIFs are based on indexed colors, which is a palette of  at most 256 colors. This helps greatly reduce their file size. These compressed  image files can be quickly transmitted over a network or the Internet, which is  why you often see them on Web pages. GIF files are great for small icons and  animated images, but they lack the color range to be used for high-quality  photos.<br /></p>
