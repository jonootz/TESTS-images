        <h1>bmp</h1>
        <p>Uncompressed raster image made up of a rectangular grid of pixels; each  pixel is a different color (or level of gray for grayscale images), which  together form an image; zooming in on a bitmap image will make it appear blocky  since the size of each pixel increases.</p>

        <p>Short for "Bitmap." It can be pronounced as "bump," "B-M-P," or simply a "bitmap  image." The BMP format is a  commonly used raster graphic format for  saving image files. It was introduced on the Windows platform, but is now  recognized by many programs on both Macs and PCs.<br /><br />The BMP format stores  color data for each pixel in the image without any compression. For example, a  10x10 pixel BMP image will include color data for 100 pixels. This method of  storing image information allows for crisp, high-quality graphics, but also  produces large file sizes. The JPEG and GIF formats are also bitmaps, but use image  compression algorithms that can significantly decrease their file size. For this  reason, JPEG and GIF images are used on the Web, while BMP images are often used  for printable images.<br /><br /></p>
